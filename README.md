# React Generate

This is a handy tool to generate React components on the fly. Feel free to use
it, as you please :) Enjoy!

Currently, the defaults are:

- React component (TSX)
- Component Types
- Module CSS
- Test file
- Component Story

## Install

Install the dependencies by typing in your terminal:
```
yarn install
```

## Usage
Generate a component by entering:
``` 
npx plop react-component
```

1. You will be asked the component name.
2. The path where the component should be generated.

If you want to generate components without any input, enter:
```
npx plop react-component -- --name ComponentName --path path/to/folder
```
